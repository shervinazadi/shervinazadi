Shervin Azadi is a researcher of Urbanism and Urban Architecture at TU Eindhoven. Shervin co-founded the Genesis Laboratory of Generative Systems and Sciences with Dr. Pirouz Nourian at TU Delft. His main interest lies in understanding the complexities of spatial planning and decision-making problems with multiple criteria and actors involved. More specifically, Shervin's work revolves around the relation of decision-support systems architecture with spatial decision-making processes. Shervin has developed algorithms and toolsets such as [topoGenesis](https://topogenesis.readthedocs.io) and [emergentium.io](https://emergentium.io/) for spatial analysis and simulations. Recently, he is investigating the potential of Urban Digital Twins for augmenting the spatial planning process.
